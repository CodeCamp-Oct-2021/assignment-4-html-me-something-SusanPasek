<article>This is my article!!</article>
 <main><p>I was born in Lebanon, IL. <em>Technically</em>, I was born at Anderson Hospital in Maryville, IL. I was raised in <b>Lebanon, IL </b>. After high school, I moved to the dorms at Saint Louis University. I then relocated to NYC for a year before living in Memphis, TN for 5 years. I currently live in Saint Louis, MO.  </p><br> </main>

<p id= testP class= funParagraph>Lebanon, IL is a small town about 30 miles east of St. Louis. I would not want to move back, but it was a decent place to grow up. The population is about 3500 and my graduating class at Lebanon High School only had 40 people. As you might imagine, there was not a lot to do. I am thankfully though I was raised somewhere safe, but I always knew small-town life wasn't for me and first got the idea that I wanted to live in New York City at the age of 10 because I loved the dance classes I was taking and decided I wanted to be a profressional dancer when I grew-up. New York City is like Mecca for dancers, in case you are unaware! </p><br>

<p>Fast-forward several years, I am 17 years old and graduating from high school; the one I mentioned earlier where there were only 40 people in my class. I want to move to New York to dance, but my parents want me to go to college and stay closer to home. A few months later, I find myself plugging in a mini fridge and trying to figure out how to loft a bed with my new, random roommate at Saint Louis University. I would make the most of dorm life and being around so many new people and make some great friends. My heart isn't in my class though and, although, I am dancing with Saint Louis Ballet, it isn't really where I want to be. After two years at SLU, I decided to audition for a dance company in New York and end up packing my bags!</p><br>

<p>Planning a move to <b>New York City</b> was exciting and over-whelming! I am glad I followed my dream and tried living there, but it turned out to not be a good fit for me. It was too crowded, loud, dirty, and expensive. After a year, I decided to was time for a change of scenery.  I will stick to just visiting!</p> <br>

<Section>This is a section!! </Section><p>Next, I landed an opportuity dancing and teaching dance in <b>Memphis, TN</b> . It was a better fit than NYC, I loved the mild winters in Memphis, but it still didn't feel like home. After about 5 years, I decided to move to Saint Louis and finish my degree at SLU. </p> 

<Section>This is another section!!</Section><p> I have been living in south <b>Saint Louis city </b> since 2014 and I love it. My family isn't too far away and Saint Louis is just the right size city for me. Also, we have the Cardinals and IMO's pizza, so that is hard to beat!</p>
<Section>Another section here!!</Section>
<p>I am not planning on leaving Saint Louis anytime soon, but who knows where I will end up? I wouldn't be opposed to somewhere with a beach! </p>
